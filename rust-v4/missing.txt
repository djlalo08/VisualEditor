1. Cacheing
2. Branch-out
  In progress -- Need to make everything that returns value, return Vec<Value>. Need to actually use OutputIndex
3. Spaces next to nodes: (i.e. ┗ + ┛ )
4. Unops can go above each other
5. Arg order doesn't work
    - This is kind of resolved. Arg order is left, top, right.
    - We should have availability for:
            a b c d e 
            ┗━┻━╋━┻━┛
                +
    - Variable arg order is important. Currently works for inputs, but not in general
6. Type system (compile time checks)
7. Scopes can be parsed, but not much else
8. Probably a left-right issue: a━━b, I think a and b end up both referencing each other?
                          b
                        a━┛  b is arg for a here
9. Inlining. Being able to say 5+5 is nice
10. This kinda thing:
       12            12  (Don't have to specify unassigned vals) 
        ┗ +   or   + ┛
          ┃        ┃
11. Input/output labelling
    a
    ┃:1->2 //or something like that, specifies which output args goes to which input arg
    b
