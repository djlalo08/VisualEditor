Verticals (i.e. s-lists) ALWAYS return their last value. We don't need s-lists to ever return more than one value -- 
- If they are _in_ a node, then any node can only ever take 1 value, so we have no reason to return multiple vals
- If they are not in a node, then anything they generate only matters as outbindings and (aha!) if we are outbinding, we don't need to return anything at all!

On the other hand, a p-list returns all of its values -- it's literally just an array. 
That's why we can use it for ins and outs.

It all makes sense. Everything is right in the world :)
