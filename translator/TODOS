Our actual stored code is in IR

This means that clojure code is only ever generated -- never read.

We need the following abilities:
    1. IR to CLJ, so we can run IR code
    2. IR to UI, so we can display IR
    3. UI to IR so changes in UI can update IR -- I actually think this is not fully correct -- what we _really_ want is IR _is_ our program representation. UI just reads and shows that. UI interacts directly with IR. So it's not "UI updates and then we translate UI to IR". Instead, it is "interacting with UI triggers updates to IR and updates to IR trigger updates to UI"

    IR includes "navigational" information like what box is currently selected
